The folder contains:
- two scripts designed to retrieve data from Bitfinex and Binance
- two scripts with the analysis of the safe haven test and collateral test
- a script with descriptive statistics and stationarity tests
- csv-files with all the data

As the data is already present in the folder it is not needed to run the data retriever scripts. 
I included them as an illustration how the data is retrieved. 
The other scripts are made so it can be run cell by cell.
